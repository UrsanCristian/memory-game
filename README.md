# Memory Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. This is a memory-based game where players need to repeat a sequence of colored buttons and tones generated by the game.

## How to Play

- Press any key to start the game.
- The game will display the current level, and a random color will flash accompanied by a sound.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
- If the sequence is correct, the game will add another step, making the sequence longer.
- If you make a mistake, the game will end, and a "Game Over" message will be displayed.
- Press any key to restart the game.

## Game Components

- Buttons: Four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) correspond to the colors in the game sequence.
- Sounds: Each button press or flash is accompanied by a corresponding sound.
- Level Display: The current level is displayed at the top of the page.
